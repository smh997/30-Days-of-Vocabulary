30-Days-of-Vocabulary
========================
An android app that shows a list of 30 words with their definition and examples so that for each day, we can learn a word. The main idea of a 30-day app is from [one of the Jetpack Compose training projects](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-30-days).

All the contents related to the words, including images, definitions, and examples, are retrieved from [WordUp English learning app](https://www.wordupapp.co/).
